# Marvel-Comics-List
A small project using Ionic (Angular + Typescript) + Javascript.
It shows a list of 100 Marvel comics.

## How to test it?
- After downloading this project and it's dependencies, run `ionic.serve`
- You can also test it on mobile devices using *Ionic DevApp*
- To Login, use this data:
  - `email@email.com`
  - `password1`

The object parsed by the API is:
```
{
"id": "1",
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "email@email.com",
"password": "password1"
}
```

# Observation
It was my first contact with this framework. It was also the first time I developed using the Angular Framework and Typescript.
There's a lot to know about TypeScript. I order to have some work to show, I added `"allowJs": true,` to *tsconfig.json* so I could use javascript code.

So far, **I learned a lot about Angular Framework and how the routing and dependencies work**. I also learned how useful is the Ionic Framework. Both, together, make the developing life much easier!
