A small project using Ionic (Angular + Typescript)

It was my first contact with this framework. It was also the first time I'm developing inside the Angular Framework and Typescript.
There's a lot to know about TypeScript. I order to have something to show, I added `"allowJs": true,` to *tsconfig.json*

login: email@email.com

password: password1

The object parsed by the API is:
```
{
"id": "1",
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "email@email.com",
"password": "password1"
}
  ```
